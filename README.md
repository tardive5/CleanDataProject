## Coursera DataScientist/CleanData Course Project

# run_analysis.R is a monolithic program, organized into 5 major steps as per assignment

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract columns mean() and standard deviation std() for X,Y,Z of each measurements
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During execution that can be quite long in some steps, some display are done to indicate where the code is.

Local directory is not changed.

Normally the code is good.

# The result file is located in "UCI HAR Dataset/result.txt"
